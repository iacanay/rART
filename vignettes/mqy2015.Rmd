This example is from Section 4.1 of "A User's Guide to Approximate Randomization Tests with a Small Number of Clusters". It is a replication of Meng, Qian and Yared (2015) which studies the effect of changes in the grain supply and mortality in China during the great famine.

# Create dummy variables

We start by making two dummy variables. The first is for the years of the famine, which spanned from 1958-1960. The second is a subset of years used in the original paper to restrict the regression.

```{r}
# famine years
mqy2015$famine <- as.integer((mqy2015$year >= 1958) & (mqy2015$year <= 1960))

# subset of years for analysis 2, 4, and 6
mqy2015$a2dumm <- (mqy2015$year >= 1953) & (mqy2015$year <= 1965)
```

# Regressions

We start with the first specification as it is the simplest. 

## Specification 1

We run the first specification using the `artlm` function.

```{r}
spreg1 <- artlm(
  ldeath_b ~ lgrain_pred:famine + lgrain_pred + lurbpop + ltotpop + year,
  cluster = province,
  data = mqy2015,
  subset = mqy2015$main,
  select = "lgrain_pred:famine"
)
```

We can get the p-value using `summary`

```{r}
summary(spreg1)
```

and the confidence intervals using `confint`.

```{r}
confint(spreg1)
```

Note that the numbers are exactly the same as in Table 1 of the paper.

## Run all six specifications

```{r}
spregs <- list(
  # Specification 1
  artlm(
    ldeath_b ~ lgrain_pred:famine + lgrain_pred + lurbpop + ltotpop + year,
    cluster = province,
    data = mqy2015,
    subset = mqy2015$main,
    select = "lgrain_pred:famine"
  ),
  # Specification 2
  artlm(
    ldeath_b ~ lgrain_pred:famine + lgrain_pred + lurbpop + ltotpop + year,
    cluster = province,
    data = mqy2015,
    subset = mqy2015$main & mqy2015$a2dumm,
    select = "lgrain_pred:famine"
  ),
  # Specification 3
  artlm(
    ldeath_b ~ lgrain_pred:famine + lgrain_pred + lurbpop + ltotpop + year,
    cluster = province,
    data = mqy2015,
    select = "lgrain_pred:famine"
  ),
  # Specification 4
  artlm(
    ldeath_b ~ lgrain_pred:famine + lgrain_pred + lurbpop + ltotpop + year,
    cluster = province,
    data = mqy2015,
    subset = mqy2015$a2dumm,
    select = "lgrain_pred:famine"
  ),
  # Specification 5
  artlm(
    ldeath_b ~ lgrain:famine + lgrain + lurbpop + ltotpop + year,
    cluster = province,
    data = mqy2015,
    subset = mqy2015$main,
    select = "lgrain:famine"
  ),
  # Specification 6
  artlm(
    ldeath_b ~ lgrain:famine + lgrain + lurbpop + ltotpop + year,
    cluster = province,
    data = mqy2015,
    subset = mqy2015$main & mqy2015$a2dumm,
    select = "lgrain:famine"
  )
)
```

# Check the values

```{r}
# get p-values (fourth column of summary)
p_values <- vapply(spregs, function(z) {summary(z)$coefficients[,4L]}, 0)

# get confidence intervals
confidence_intervals <- vapply(spregs, confint, numeric(2L))

knitr::kable(cbind("Pr(>|t|)" = p_values, t(confidence_intervals)))
```

Which are the same values as in Table 1 of the paper.
